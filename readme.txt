Project has been developed using python 3 and is divided into 3 parts:-

1) Understanding and implementing morphological operations to remove noise from an image.

2) Segmentation of an image using heuristic thresholding.

3) Using hough transform for line and circle detection.

This project has been developed using python as part of coursework CSE573 Computer Vision at SUNY- University at Buffalo.

The 3 tasks are placed in their respective subfolders.

Task 3 uses the templates from subfoder templates to draw bounding boxes and display the position of the boxes. So, run the code along with the templates or comment out the line in the code which calls the 'bounds' function.
